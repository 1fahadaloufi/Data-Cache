# Data Cache

## About 
This repository contains SystemVerilog code that behaviorly models a 2-way set-associative cache controller with 32 cache lines in each way. 

The data cache also has a block size of 2 words where each word is 32 bits wide. It is also implements a write-back policy and uses LRU (least recently used) strategy to determine way to write to.
